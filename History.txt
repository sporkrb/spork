== 1.0.0rc3 ==

* Forward-port fixes from 0.9.1

== 1.0.0rc0 ==

* Split out application framework support to separate gems.
    This will allow more precise dependency constraints between known working versions of application frameworks (Rails) and the plugin to add support for the framework, hopefully reducing confusion and increasing reliability.

* All tests pass in ruby 1.9.2

== 0.9.1 ==

* Fixes issue introduced by diagnoser. (Alex Southgate)

== 0.9.0 ==

* Cucumber-rails 1.0.0 is supported (Stephen Bannasch)
* Workaround for rubygems bug require (Stephen Bannasch)
* RSpec 1.x and >= 2 support (David Chelimsky)
* Specs use rspec 2.6 conventions (David Chelimsky).

== 0.9.0rc7 ==

* Resolved: Gem.latest_load_paths workound didn't do what it was expected to, and wasn't backwards compatible with earlier rubygems.

== 0.9.0rc6 ==

* Fixes specs and features to run on Ruby 1.9.2
* No longer depend on Gem.latest_load_paths, as it is deprecated (and broken) with rubygems 1.8.0

* require date for Date.today as some instances are found without it loaded

* show output each time spork is invoked

* jruby friendlier / windows friendlier (rogerdpack)

== 0.9.0 RC2 ==

* ignore exceptions raised by ActiveRecord establish_connection
* A few issues with integration tests resolved

== 0.9.0 RC ==

* Rails 3.0 compatibility.  (not backwards compatible, right now.  For rails 2.x, use spork 0.8.x)

(TODO: extract rails framework support into rspec-rails.  They really should be separate.)

== 0.8.4

* Add adapter for Padrino (Elliot Winkler)

== 0.7.7

* prevent exceptions not caught from invoking Prefork at_exit hooks
* process at_exit hooks trapped inside of an each_run in reverse order, similar to Kernel#at_exit

== 0.7.6

* output tested rails versions to TESTED_RAILS_VERSIONS.txt
* bugfix: "Custom helper aren't found when running spork"
* bugfix: ruby-debug no longer blows up if breakpoint occurs during preload phase

== 0.7.1

== fixes

* allow normal debugger to operate if tests not run within spork

== 0.6.3

== fixes

* the regression fix in 0.6.2 was not actually a bug with spork, but a bug with the test framework integration, and fixing it this way broke cucumber and rspec. doh! (sorry)

== 0.6.2

== Bug-fix

* fixes regression where entry point was not being loaded (which basically rendered Spork speed gains non-existent)
* prevent the client from listening for DRb calls

== 0.6.1

== Bug-fix

* fixes regression where abort wasn't working.

== 0.6.0

== Features

* auto-load spork supplementary test_framework gems. This will allow anyone to release a gem that enables support for a given test framework. (spork-testunit)

=== Notably

* refactoring. RunStrategy extracted from server, paving the way for different ways of running tests (windows support)

== 0.5.11

=== Bugfixes

* bugfix: no-longer load cucumber when rspec is being used

=== Notably

* refactoring. TestFramework class extracted from Server (should've been that way from the beginning). Runner no longer handling TestFramework selection logic, extracted that to a factory method. Hurray for refactoring.

== 0.5.3 2009-06-08

 === Bugfixes
