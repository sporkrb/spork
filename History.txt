== 0.6.3

== fixes

* the regression fix in 0.6.2 was not actually a bug with spork, but a bug with the test framework integration, and fixing it this way broke cucumber and rspec. doh! (sorry)

== 0.6.2

== Bug-fix

* fixes regression where entry point was not being loaded (which basically rendered Spork speed gains non-existent)
* prevent the client from listening for DRb calls

== 0.6.1

== Bug-fix

== 0.5.11

=== Bugfixes

* bugfix: no-longer load cucumber when rspec is being used

=== Notably

* refactoring. TestFramework class extracted from Server (should've been that way from the beginning). Runner no longer handling TestFramework selection logic, extracted that to a factory method. Hurray for refactoring.

== 0.5.3 2009-06-08
